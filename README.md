# icfp2024

Our team's collaboration for [ICFP Contest 2024](https://icfpcontest2024.github.io/).

# Notes
* Team name
* Technology: Whatever you feel like, ready to share through either shared modules, small CLI interfaces, HTTP interfaces
* Chat on discord, share ideas and progress reports
* Commit early, commit often! Straight to `main`
* Previous strategies
  * Lots of independent CLI tools
  * Unix pipes in/out with JSON (line-oriented if streaming)
  * Visualize the problem
  * Tools/UI to solve the problem manually
  * Solve the problem with a bot
  * Combine bots
  * Build a way to score -- both locally and globally
    * Sometimes this uses the org API to score, but local scoring is better for algorithms
  * If it is a collection of problems, keep a folder of problems and solutions
  * Put the most important info in the filename -- the problem identifier and score
  * Scripts to submit (individual or bulk) standalone solutions to organizers
